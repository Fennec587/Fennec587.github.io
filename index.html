     <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Hydrogen engines go back a lot further than you might think! More than two centuries ago, the French inventor, 
        François Isaac de Rivas, developed a primitive engine that was powered by hydrogen and oxygen and ignited by an electric spark. Hydrogen vehicles can
         be powered in 2 different ways:

 <div style="font-style: italic;" ALIGN="Center">

     <h3 style = "color:rgb(12, 3, 67)" >Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle - a hydrogen fuel car is powered with an electric motor. It consists of a fuel cell, a device 
        that takes chemical energy in the form of hydrogen and turns it into electricity that can power an electric motor, just like a battery! First, hydrogen is 
        stored in a tank that is thick walled and crash tested. The tank is usually stored under the rear seat. Then, hydrogen is mixed with air and pumped into the
        fuel cell. Inside the fuel cell, a chemical reaction extracts electrons from the hydrogen. The leftover hydrogen protons move across the cell and combine with 
        the oxygen from the air to produce water. Meanwhile, the electrons create electricity which charges a small storage battery used to power an  electric 
        drivetrain, just like an electric vehicles (E.V.)! This is why the vehicles are called fuel cell electric vehicles as compared to the battery electric 
         vehicles which are seen increasingly on our roads already. 
    </h3>
    
     <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> The biggest difference between E.V.s and fuel cell hydrogen cars is the source of electricity. Electric cars run on batteries
         charged electrically. But hydrogen powered cars produce their own electricity, they have their own little power plant on board which is the fuel cell. 
         Another is in the exhaust system. The absence of carbon means that no CO is produced, eliminating the greenhouse gas emissions of a conventional gasoline 
         car. Instead of toxic nitrogen, the only thing that comes out of that exhaust pipe is water, as the main biproduct of their combustion cycle. Because of 
         the heat also produced by hydrogen cars, they are not considered zero emissions. But they are much less harmful than gasoline cars.
    </h3> 
 
     <h3 style = "color:rgb(84, 0, 0)" > Internal Combustion Engine - These types of vehicles are different to fuel cell hydrogen cars due to the combustion
         process. The hydrogen I.C. engine is a modified version of the conventional gasoline engine. In this way, the process is similar to that of the other 
         high temperature fuels like gasoline, diesel or natural gas. Hydrogen engines are actually similar to gasoline engines in a lot of ways. 
         They both use a four-stroke design for intake, compression, ignition and exhaust. They also make the same sorts of sound.

     <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Hydrogen as so far struggled to deliver its initial promise as an alternative fuel for transport, but is a topic that refuses 
        to go away. There is still great potential in its use in hydrogen fuel cells to generate emission free engines. A couple of manufacturers already have their
         hydrogen models on the market.
    </h3> 

     <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Hydrogen is a cleaner fuel than petrol or diesel. It is completely emission free when converted into a fuel cell system to
         generate electricity. Hydrogen is difficult to handle. Due to its very small molecular size of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen is able to leak through many 
         solids. The remaining hydrogen is potentially explosive!  Hydrogen is much less fussy than petrol or diesel, mixing and burning fully and efficiently in a 
         much wider air: fuel ratio. With the fuel cell, the vehicle contains much of the hydrogen tank, fuel cells as well as electric motors, all combined into a 
         corresponding unit. The hydrogen I.C. engine simplifies the hardware as it is essentially the good old combustion engine that has been converted to run
         on hydrogen. Existing engines can be converted to run on petrol or diesel by changing some components, such as the fuel delivery system and spark plugs. 
         An example being Toyota’s development of a hydrogen powered three-cylinder engine, taken from the GR Yaris, a 1.6 litre turbocharged car, and used to power
          a specially designed corolla sport, used to compete in the Fuji 24 hours endurance race.
    </h3> 

     <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> How do you refuel a hydrogen car? A hydrogen refuelling station looks a lot like a gasoline refuelling station. In some 
         countries, hydrogen fuel is supplied along with petrol and diesel. You can fill it like gasoline cars. A hydrogen bowser consists of a pump with a nozzle
         that clamps onto the car. Once the seal has been made, hydrogen gas begins to fill the tank. If seal is not attached, it will not start pumping so that no 
         leakage happens. Hydrogen refuelling stations can fill a typical hydrogen car in about five minutes and once refuelled, it can travel about 300 miles or
         480 kilometres! Compare that to E.V.s which can only go 100 to 200 miles per charge, or 161 to 322km
    </h3>

     <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Hydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet and it is also the cleanest type of fuel, having powered engines long 
         before 1807. However, hydrogen hasn’t really taken off in the motoring world. Meanwhile, E.V.s car sales continue to grow, with E.V.s selling 162% more 
         than their previous years record. Hydrogen can’t develop well because of the existing infrastructure. There are only a small number of hydrogen fuel 
         stations, but nowhere near enough that drivers can operate with these cars. Hydrogen vehicles are less efficient than E.V.s. because hydrogen does not 
         occur naturally, it must be extracted then compressed in the fuel tank.
